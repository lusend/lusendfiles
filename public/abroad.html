          quickly laid to rest upon meeting the charming students that I would
          get to have this incredible experience with.<br /><br />
          What I learned on this trip was that I am a unique and multifaceted
          person that has very diverse interests, and this trip fed my soul.
          Castles, museums and INCREDIBLE history around every corner. Taking in
          the amazing surroundings of England and soaking up every educational
          opportunity at my fingertips, all while making incredible new friends
          and fulfilling my dream of seeing as much of God’s beautiful earth as
          possible, this trip was truly a gift.<br /><br />
          Quite simply, studying abroad in London changed my life in a way that
          only God can. It was a journey of self-discovery and self-love, and an
          incredible amount of fun. God showed me what I am capable of on this
          trip, and there is no stopping me now. I would not trade one moment of
          this experience for anything.<br /><br />
          Follow your heart, listen to what God is saying to you, and
          go…study…abroad!”

          “You can never really begin to grasp how big God is until you take a
          step out of your own corner of the world and begin to interact with
          different people in new places – especially with those who look,
          think, and act differently than you. Throughout my time student
          teaching at West Nairobi School in Kenya, I not only was able to build
          relationships with locals, but also with students and staff from all
          over the world. Every day was like a taste of heaven on earth. Who
          wouldn't want an experience like that? I never would have considered
          myself as an ideal candidate to live and teach in Africa. Yet the Lord
          stretched and grew me in so many ways as Nairobi began to become home.
          Anyone who is looking to experience God in a new and fresh way and
          grow like never before should pursue a study abroad or international
          internship opportunity. You won’t regret it!”

          “Studying abroad was outrageously surreal. There are no words to
          accurately describe what an extraordinary experience it was to meet
          all kinds of people, experience a culture completely different than
          ours, and jump into something with blind faith. I was in Florence,
          Italy for eight weeks and I just have to brag on the personality of
          the town. The people were eager to share their customs with us, the
          architecture and art was stunning, and the amount I was able to learn
          in such a short time was incomparable. One takeaway I learned from
          this experience was how laid back an authentic Italian city is. We are
          very go-go-go, but Florence still held the unplugged charm of an older
          time. People stayed out late, spent hours talking over dinner, and
          stopped in the middle of the cobblestone streets to start a
          conversation... life was like something out of a movie. At first, this
          was a bit of a shock to me - I always feel like there is somewhere to
          be. Florentines are casual and want to spend time with each other.
          This trip reminded me that all the piles of stuff we collect in this
          life mean nothing in the end. Instead, we need to focus on our souls.
          Quality time is so important and taking the time to study abroad is
          definitely some healthy quality time we could all use. Florence has my
          heart; I so recommend venturing out there yourself so it can take
          yours.”

          abroad were unforgettable. I traveled to eleven countries in Europe in

          except my classmates spoke English, and thus, I had to learn to adapt
          my communication while trying to speak their language. Studying abroad
          also taught me to have greater trust in God. I had prayed for months
          that God would provide another Christian in my program, and sure
          enough, God provided, like He always does. Studying abroad was an

          “My time studying in Berlin Germany helped me see things from a
          broader perspective. Through many conversations I had with those I
          met, I gained a better understanding not only of cultures outside of
          the US but also of how these cultures view America. When people found
          out I was American questions almost immediately began about Trump, the
          proposed wall, and the why behind them both. But as I would talk to
          people about these things, I also began to understand their stance and
          why they held that position. It helped me to see things from a
          perspective that was not my own.<br /><br />
          Over spring break I traveled to the UK. One evening, I was talking to
          some of the other guests at the hostel I was at; they were all from
          other parts of Europe. As we were talking about our different cultures
          and languages, one man from Greece pointed out how lucky I was.
          English is my first language and because of that I can easily converse
          with people from other countries. But for him and most Europeans, he
          was required to learn English as it is the common language that unites
          Europe and much of the world. It was this conversation and many others
          like it during my time in Europe that left me with a better
          understanding of the views of other cultures and how Americans are

          treasure your experiences in your heart, and don’t be afraid to be
          vulnerable in sharing all of the highs and lows of your experiences
          with people. When you return home, be present and remember that you

          with my host mom, conquered my fear of flying, mastered the art of the
          European weekend trip and made meaningful connections with people from
          different cultures. Study abroad was not without its difficulties. It
          was hard to adjust to living in a homestay. The Andalusian accent had
