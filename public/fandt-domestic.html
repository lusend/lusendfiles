            before departure) in order to process excused absences, Assumption

              </li>
              <li>
                These trips require the student to sign an Assumption of Risk
                Form. LU Send will work with the faculty and student to make
                sure this is taken care of.

            requiring students to physically meet in a location outside of the
            home state of their institution for instructional purposes more than
            twice per full-term course for a total of more than six hours is
            considered out of compliance. As you can imagine, this impacts all
            of our academic opportunities for domestic trips that are held
            outside of the state of Virginia. If you are interested in proposing
            a domestic trip in the future with your department, please consider

            Domestic Student Travel encompasses a large variety of trips, but

              <li>
                Students cannot be leads on a trip, but GSAs can support leads

              </li>
              <li>
                The academic lead needs to be qualified and approved if not the
                professor (such as a GSA or another faculty member)
              </li>
              <li>
                Overnight trips must have both a female and a male leader if
                there are both genders participating.
              </li>
              <li>
                All drivers must be approved by Transit to drive the vehicle
                chosen for the trip.

              <li>
                Leaders taking students to an endorsed event outside the local

                LU vehicle.

            We take the safety and security of our students seriously, here are
            a few guidelines to help our leaders be prepared for possible
            situations:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Be conscious of how it would play out if one of the students
                becomes ill or injured and needs medical care. Who would stay
                with the student? Who would stay with the other students?
                Preferably, students should not be left alone without
                supervision. This would also apply to any situation that
                separates the group.
              </li>
              <li>
                Plan accordingly to eliminate as many Title IX situations as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be aware of the liability of driving students in a personal
                vehicle as opposed to a rental or LU vehicle. It may be wise to
                budget for those last-minute traveling needs at the end of the
                semester/year.
              </li>
              <li>
                Advisable for all leaders to read Procurement’s Travel Policies
                & Procedures and Sign the Policy Acknowledgement Letter.
              </li>
              <li>
                Register your trip as soon as possible to ensure that all facets
                of the process are done in a timely manner.
